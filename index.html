			I've always had a tendency to be unsatisfied with a particular hobby until I could contribute a creation of my own to it, and as an enthusiast for flying discs as well as origami, it was only a matter of time before I would set out to design my own, functional frisbee assembled from nothing but folded paper.

			The first model I created was actually an accident. I love fiddling with paper when bored and tend to produce abstract, symmetrical shapes when doing so absentmindedly. One day in high school I looked down at my hands as the bell rang for lunch and saw that I'd done it again, turning a perfectly good page of schoolwork into a polygonal mess of folds. The though passed briefly through my head that my creation looked rather like a frisbee, and so I decided to toss it like one just to see what would happen. To my surprise, it did not flutter to the ground like paper usually does, but spun and glided in a relatively orderly fashion. I would come to realize later that this is how most smaller, stiffer paper objects tend to fly, including playing cards, but to my high school brain this sparked inspiration.

			What you see depicted below is the result of a multi-year journey of on and off experimentation, stumbling upon model after model and pitting each against its predecessor until I arrived at a design that proved satisfactory in stability, agility, and durability. Fortunately for the kids I work with, yet rather anticlimactically for me, this final design is by far the simplest I've come up with, requiring just 3 folds per module.

			Like any flying object weighing just a few grams, it is easily deflected by even the slightest wind, so it's best reserved for indoor play, but when thrown properly it can travel further your standard paper airplane, and with greater accuracy.

			Throwing a paper frisbee is similar to throwing a traditional frisbee in the way that swinging a badminton racket is similar to swinging a tennis racket. The technique is the same, but, being so light, a paper frisbee requires a much higher spin-to-velocity ratio to keep its flight steady, and thus your throwing motion should involve a much more aggressive snap of the wrist, and almost no arm movement whatsoever. Furthermore, because of the increased spin, paper frisbees tend to curve inwards, so its reccomended to hold your frisbee with the far side tilted down to combat this.
